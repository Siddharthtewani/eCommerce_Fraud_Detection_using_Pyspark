## Background  
In the dynamic world of eCommerce, **Monash Fashion Corporation (MFC)** has established itself as a leading online retailer of fashion products. While offering a seamless shopping experience, MFC faces significant risks due to increasing fraudulent activities. Traditional fraud detection methods are insufficient to combat sophisticated fraud tactics.  

The company seeks an advanced **real-time fraud detection system** to analyze transaction data, identify suspicious patterns, and mitigate risks efficiently.  

---

## Problem Statement  
Fraudulent transactions, especially **Card-Not-Present (CNP) Fraud**, have caused significant financial and reputational damage. The challenge lies in designing a scalable and efficient real-time solution using **Apache Spark's** data processing capabilities to detect and prevent such fraudulent activities.  

### Example of CNP Fraud Procedure:  
1. A fraudster places an order with a stolen credit card.  
2. The payment is processed, and the order is shipped.  
3. The rightful cardholder disputes the transaction.  
4. The bank reverses the payment, causing a loss to the company.  

---

## Objective  
Develop an advanced fraud detection application using:  
- **Apache Spark MLlib**  
- **Spark Streaming**  

The system should:  
1. Detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning models.  
2. Handle large-scale transaction data efficiently.  
3. Provide real-time visualizations for the operations team.

## Datasets  
1. **category.csv**: Product category information.  
2. **customer.csv**: Customer details.  
3. **product.csv**: Product details.  
4. **transaction.csv**: Sales transaction records.  
5. **browsing_behaviour.csv**: Customersâ€™ browsing activities.  
6. **customer_session.csv**: Relationship between sessions and customers.  
7. **fraud_transaction.csv**: List of identified fraudulent transactions.
